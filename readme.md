# Data Engineering Project on GCP -> Uber analysis

<br>

# Introduction
Data engineering is a crucial aspect of any data-driven organization. It involves the collection, transformation, and storage of data to enable efficient data analysis and decision-making processes.

This project provides a framework and set of tools to facilitate various data engineering tasks, such as data ingestion, data integration, data processing and reporting dashboard.

# Roadmap:
From raw data to report

1. Extract datas from "NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission"
2. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) with Jupyter Notebooks
3. Store raw datas on a datalake: GCP Cloud storage
4. ETL Process with Mage-AI and GCP Compute engine
5. Push golden datas into a data warehouse GCP BigQuery
6. Create a web dashboard with Looker Studio by Google
